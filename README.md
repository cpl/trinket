Is a server mimic for COMP28112 exercise 2, which gives you the ability to run it locally and configure it as you wish. No more annoying errors while debugging, no more undefined/unexpected responses. You now have control over the system and can test all edge cases of your program.

## Why ?

* Are you a second year CS student at The University of Manchester?
* You looked over your choices and thought to yourself, "Wow, distributed computing sounds awesome!"?
* You started working on your second lab for COMP28112?
* Did you get tired with the server responding with **404**, **402**, **503**, **400**, Error 482: Somebody shot the server with a 12-gauge. Please contact your administrator?

If the answer to any of the above is YES, then you are in the right place!

While the second lab for COMP28112 is one of my favourtie labs (because it attempts to recreate a real-world distributed system environment with all of it's flaws and annoyances), but having to test your bot on a server which can respond with an error code 10+ times in a row just because it wants to can get infurating really fast. During my year, it wasn't that bad, I caught on early and developed my bot to handle *anything* you throw at it!

But seeing the current second year students struggle with the server (to the point where they doubt the corectness of their programs) gave me the great idea of "reverse engineering"/mimicking the "protocol" as used by the course BUT with a few improvements.

## Features

* Run the server locally (no need to be in Kilburn or to use the VPN)
* Easy to configure
  * Disable errors
  * Set/Clear/Block slots
  * View requests as they go in the backend
